I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Geography](https://geog.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida, where I work under [Dr. Brian Child](https://geog.ufl.edu/faculty/child/). My academic research centers on collaborative governance of natural resources and community conservation in southern Africa. Most of my work focuses on the social and institutional correlates of community participation in CBNRM governance. My other interests include institutional development, the economics of wildlife in working landscapes, and social-ecological systems in southern Africa’s drylands.

With Dr. Child's lab at UF, I am contributing to the development of a professional certificate and field trainings for community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) practitioners working on the ground in southern and east Africa. We call the project [LifeThroughWildlife](https://www.lifethroughwildlife.com/). Our effort is to help build an international network of impact-oriented professionals and academics working to build effective community governance and wildlife economy planning.

Prior to attending the University of Florida, I received an MA in political science from [Villanova University](https://youtu.be/L7FFJUz0tdo?si=jgOCXXAFlkqtNWhD) and a BA in journalism from Ithaca College in “gorges” Ithaca, NY, America’s finest college town.
