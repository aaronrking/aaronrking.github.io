I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Geography](https://geog.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida, where I work under [Dr. Brian Child](https://geog.ufl.edu/faculty/child/). My academic research centers on community governance of wildlife and natural resources in southern Africa. Most of my work focuses on the relationship between participatory forms of governance and social empowerment—the development of social capital and trust and their effect on collective action.

With Dr. Child and the rest of our lab, I am contributing to the development of a series of trainings for community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) practitioners working on the ground in southern Africa. We call the project [LifeThroughWildlife](https://www.lifethroughwildlife.com/). Our effort is to help build an international network of impact-oriented professionals and academics working to build effective community governance and wildlife economy planning.

Prior to attending the University of Florida, I received an MA in political science from [Villanova University](https://youtu.be/L7FFJUz0tdo?si=jgOCXXAFlkqtNWhD) and a BA in journalism from Ithaca College in “gorges” Ithaca, NY, America’s finest college town.
